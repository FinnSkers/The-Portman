Here’s a consolidated list of all major potential problems for FinnSkers/The-Portman, each paired with a probable solution:

1. Technical & Implementation Challenges
Complex AI Parsing (CV Extraction)

Problem: Diverse file types and formats are hard to parse accurately.
Solution: Use robust parsing libraries (e.g., Apache Tika, pdfplumber). Allow manual correction by users. Continuously improve with user feedback.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Complexity

Problem: Difficult to tune, may produce irrelevant results.
Solution: Start with simple retrieval, then upgrade. Fine-tune with domain data. Regularly monitor and retrain models.
Integration Bugs

Problem: Combining AI, web, and site generation increases bug risk.
Solution: Write thorough integration tests. Use CI/CD. Modularize the codebase for easier debugging.
Performance Bottlenecks

Problem: Slow processing can hurt user experience.
Solution: Optimize backend for asynchronous tasks. Use caching. Profile code regularly.
Model/Library Drift

Problem: AI models and dependencies require constant updates.
Solution: Schedule routine updates, use dependency management, monitor vulnerabilities.
Scalability Difficulties

Problem: Scaling up with many users can be costly and complex.
Solution: Use serverless/scalable cloud options. Optimize resource use. Monitor and plan for growth.
Incomplete/Buggy Output

Problem: Edge cases create broken portfolios.
Solution: Allow user review and editing of parsed data. Rigorous testing with real CV samples.
2. User Experience Issues
Inaccurate Parsing

Problem: Broken or incomplete portfolios.
Solution: Let users review/edit before publishing. Show clear error messages.
Limited Customization

Problem: Users can’t easily adjust their portfolios.
Solution: Provide an intuitive editor, templates, and drag-and-drop features.
Onboarding/Upload Friction

Problem: Users may find the process confusing or tedious.
Solution: Streamline onboarding, use clear guides/tooltips, and provide sample CVs.
Poor Error Messaging

Problem: Users don’t understand what went wrong.
Solution: Implement explicit, helpful error messages for unsupported formats or failures.
3. Business & Market Risks
Heavy Competition

Problem: Many strong alternatives exist.
Solution: Highlight unique features (AI benchmarking, personalization). Target niche audiences first.
Differentiation Challenges

Problem: Standing out is difficult.
Solution: Focus on features competitors lack. Gather and display user testimonials.
Unclear Monetization

Problem: No clear business model.
Solution: Survey users for willingness to pay. Start with a freemium model. Explore B2B partnerships.
Low Early Adoption

Problem: No stars, forks, or issues yet.
Solution: Seek early adopters, beta testers, and feedback. Engage developer communities.
Lack of Feedback

Problem: Hard to know user needs or problems.
Solution: Proactively ask for feedback, run surveys, and monitor user analytics.
4. Security & Privacy
Sensitive Data Handling

Problem: Risk of privacy breaches.
Solution: Encrypt data at rest and in transit. Allow users to delete data. Follow privacy best practices.
Compliance with Laws

Problem: Must follow GDPR, CCPA, etc.
Solution: Consult legal experts. Implement transparent privacy policies and consent flows.
5. Project Management & Resources
Limited Contributors/Time/Funding

Problem: Hard to address all issues quickly.
Solution: Focus on core features first. Encourage open-source contributions. Seek grants/sponsorships.
Documentation Gaps

Problem: Poor docs hinder user/developer onboarding.
Solution: Write clear, concise guides for users and contributors. Use examples/screenshots.
Misaligned Priorities

Problem: Building the wrong features or focusing on the wrong problems.
Solution: Prioritize based on user feedback and analytics.
